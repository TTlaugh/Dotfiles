# Get a one-time password, or add a OTP secret to your pass-otp store.

# The assumption of this script is that all otp passwords are stored with the
# suffix `-otp`. This script automatically appends newly added otps as such.

# For OTP passwords to be generated properly, it is important for the local
# computer to have its time properly synced. This can be done with the command
# below which requires the package `ntp`.


# Dependencies: pass, pass-otp, maim, zbar, ntp
